# About

I'm a TypeScript developer. I live in Gyeonggi, South Korea and work as a backend developer at Yanolja Cloud Korea. I'm interested in system architecture, development productivity, and team building. I'm especially interested in **system architecture and development productivity for cost reduction**. The reason why I am thinking about cost reduction system architect and development productivity is because I think that just as we try to reduce costs in manufacturing, we should make similar efforts in the development field to increase the lifespan of teams and developers. I am thinking about various ways to improve development productivity, and one of them is open source development. So I'm an open source developer myself, and I work on a lot of open source projects on github, and I try to drive development productivity through open source.

I've worked in a variety of companies, both large and small. The most important skill for a developer is, of course, good development skills. But I think what is often overlooked is the ability to **release a quality product on time**. The improvement in development productivity I mentioned earlier is tied to this ability to manage schedules. By automating various tasks and automatically generating TypeScript code, I've been trying to improve development efficiency and code quality at the same time to release good products on time. This experience is applied in my open source project, which focuses on documentation automation, code generation, and a series of automated processes.

As company or business grows, so does your traffic. An architecture built to reduce costs can become meaningless if it can't handle large volumes of traffic. That's why we need a flexible architecture design that can scale with the growth of the company or business. We are constantly thinking about a flexible architecture that can handle such large amounts of traffic and scale smoothly.

The TypeScript language is widely used on the backend and frontend, and is aimed at full-stack developers. I'm interested in Express.js and Fastify.js, React.js, Next.js, and Svelte, and I'm also dabbling in languages like Go and Kotlin.

## Hobbies and Favorite things

I love TypeScript and prefer to work on various open source projects utilizing TypeScript. I have developed a number of open source projects and use them in my work. I am also a gamer. I use Steam and Steamdeck to play a variety of games.
